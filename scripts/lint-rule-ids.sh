# Verify rule-ID grammar and per-file uniqueness in framework/rules/*.md.
#
# Per the rule schema, every level-3 heading in a rule file is a rule ID and
# carries nothing but the ID. Each MUST match the grammar
# `{SURFACE}-{CATEGORY}-{NNN}`:
#   - SURFACE   one of BE, FE, CFG, QUAL (registered surfaces)
#   - CATEGORY  [A-Z][A-Z0-9]*  (uppercase alphanumeric; first char a letter)
#   - NNN       a 3- or 4-digit zero-padded sequence number
# IDs MUST be unique within a file.
#
# This catches the failure mode where a category abbreviation drifts from the
# schema grammar that the runtime `check-rule-ids` harvester relies on
# (e.g. a digit-bearing category the harvester regex does not match).
#
# Source of truth: specs/008-security-rules/data-model.md (BE/FE surfaces),
