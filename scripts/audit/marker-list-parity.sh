# scripts/audit/marker-list-parity.sh — Family 18 of /audit.
#
# Binds the `criterion-path-existence` non-assertion marker list — and the
# negated-creation predicate's word lists beside it — to their canonical
# source, so the three restatements of each cannot drift from it.
#
# The list decides when an acceptance criterion is *not* claiming its paths
# are present — a deletion, a rename, a migration subject, an adopter-scoped
# path, a hedge — and so decides which findings the family suppresses. It
# lives in four places by necessity:
#
#   * `specs/045-decision-state-drift-detection/data-model.md` — the canonical
#     source, per the constitution's canonical-sources map;
#   * `runtime/src/primitives/check_artifacts.rs` — `NON_ASSERTION_MARKERS`,
#     the implementation;
#   * `framework/commands/analyze.md` — the adopter-facing restatement. This
#     one cannot be replaced by a pointer: `analyze.md` ships to adopter
#     projects, which have no copy of 045's data-model;
#   * `specs/022-deterministic-runtime/scenarios/criterion-path-existence-family.md`
#     — carries the count and the group names, not the phrases.
#
# Nothing compared them. Adding three phrases (022 scenario
# `criterion-non-assertion-phrasings`) meant hand-editing all four, and a
# missed one would have left a canonical source lying about shipped
# behaviour — the exact drift §drift-prevention exists to catch, in the
# check built to catch it. Surfaced as a QUAL-GROUND-001 SHOULD by
# `/ductus:review` on 022, 2026-08-03.
#
# Method:
#   18a Derive the marker set from the canonical table in 045's data-model.
#       A failed or empty derivation is a finding, never a silent pass —
#       the same fail-closed direction Family 17 takes.
#   18b Parse `NON_ASSERTION_MARKERS` out of `check_artifacts.rs` and compare
#       as a set, plus assert the declared array length matches.
#   18c Parse `analyze.md`'s restatement and compare as a set.
#   18d Compare the spelled-out counts in both markdown restatements against
#       the derived size.
#   18e Do 18a-18c again for the negated-creation predicate's vocabulary —
#       the sixth exemption group, which is a clause-scoped predicate rather
#       than a phrase, and so carries two closed word lists of its own in the
#       same three places. No count arm: its prose states no count, which is
#       deliberate (a count that is never written cannot go stale).
#
# Table convention: a phrase whose trailing space is significant is written
# `` `text` + space `` in markdown, because a trailing space inside an inline
# code span trips markdownlint MD038. The derivation reverses that here, in
# one place, so the documents stay lint-clean and the comparison stays exact.
#
# Deliberately NOT a finding:
#   - Group names or row ordering. The check is on the phrase *set*; the
#     grouping is editorial and readers, not code, consume it. 18e compares
#     the predicate's two word lists as one union for the same reason: a
#     negator swapped into the verb row is not a drift mode anyone has, while
#     a word dropped from either list is, and the union catches that.
#   - The 022 scenario's phrase-free prose. It states counts and group names
#     only, and its count is covered by 18d.
#
# Requires `python3`.
