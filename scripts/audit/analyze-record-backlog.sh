# scripts/audit/analyze-record-backlog.sh — Family 37 of /audit.
#
# Every `done` spec that carries a review record and no analyze record — the
# exact population the `analyze-state-drift` check family grandfathers.
#
# Since spec 057 each record lives in the artifact that owns it: the review
# record in `review.md`, the analyze record in `analysis.md`, and `spec.md`
# carries neither. **The absent artifact is the never-run state**, so that is
# what this family counts. An artifact that exists but whose frontmatter does
# not parse is undeterminable, which is a finding rather than an exemption:
# collapsing it into never-run would grow the exempt set with a defect.
#
# WHY THE EXEMPTION EXISTS, AND WHY IT NEEDS THIS. Spec 047 gave
# `/{project}:analyze` a durable record so the pipeline's second gate could be
# enforced; before it, a spec that had passed both gates and one that had
# passed only the review were byte-identical on disk. Every `done` spec
# written before that record existed therefore has no analyze record, and the
# drift family exempts them.
#
# 046 refused exactly this shape of exemption for scenario questions — "a
# sanctioned hiding place is worse than the gap it papers over" — and the
# criterion-label check backfilled the corpus rather than grandfathering it.
# So the precedent runs against exempting, and the difference is what a
# backfill would have to assert. A criterion label is **derivable from the
# artifact**: that backfill computed a value that was already true. An analyze
# record asserts *that a run happened*, which nothing on disk can substantiate.
# Backfilling it would mean writing an unverified claim into the field a later
# gate trusts — the precise failure the record was added to prevent, committed
# by the mechanism itself. So the exemption stands, and this family is the
# price of it: the set is **named, counted, and shrinking** instead of silent.
#
# It cannot grow. `check-review-gate` has no grandfather clause, so no spec can
# reach `done` from here without a record; every member of this set predates
# the field, and re-analyzing one removes it permanently. A count that goes up
# means something is wrong with that claim, which is itself worth knowing.
#
# A RATCHET, NOT A WALL — and this suite has no advisory tier, which is what
# forces the design. `emit` sets `drift` and every family exits on it, so a
# family that reported 54 pre-existing specs as findings would red-line every
# run forever and be learned-ignored, which is worse than not checking. But a
# family that only printed a number could never fail, and a check that cannot
# fail is not a check.
#
# So the backlog is held against a committed high-water mark
# (`analyze-record-baseline.txt`). At or below it: clean, with the count on
# stderr. Above it: a finding, because the backlog **cannot legitimately
# grow** — `check-review-gate` has no grandfather clause, so nothing can reach
# `done` without a record, and every member of the set predates the field.
# Growth means the gate was bypassed, which is exactly the defect the record
# was added to prevent, recurring.
#
# The maintainer lowers the baseline as specs are re-analyzed; the file is the
# ratchet's pawl. Lowering it is the only way to make the set smaller on
# paper, and re-analyzing is the only way to make it smaller in fact, so the
# two cannot drift apart without this family saying so.
#
# These specs are not defective. They were completed correctly under the rules
# that existed when they were completed, and re-litigating that is not what
# this family is for.
#
# THE SUBJECT IS `done` SPECS WITH A `review.md`. A `done` spec with *neither*
# artifact predates `/{project}:review` too and is already grandfathered by
# that family; it is counted separately and reported as such rather than
# folded in, because the two populations drain through different commands and
# a single number would hide which.
#
# An empty spec corpus is a finding, never a pass: a family that enumerated
# nothing must not exit like one that examined everything.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS system bash). The frontmatter scan computes in
# python3 and renders tab-separated records the shell feeds to `emit` — the
# convention ./README.md records for the families that compute in python.
