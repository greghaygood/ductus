# scripts/audit/adopter-shell-behavior.sh — Family 22 of /audit.
#
# The shipped adopter shell works in an adopter's tree, not just in ours.
#
# `framework/bootstrap/hooks/ductus-pre-commit` is executed by adopters, but
# this repo runs a *different copy* of that same job: our `.githooks/pre-commit`
# is a separate file, and our own layout uses the default spec root with a
# locally built runtime. Every assumption those two facts mask is invisible to a
# green run here. Three defects reached adopters through exactly that gap on
# 2026-08-17, all silent and all exit 0:
#
#   * the config ladder had no `.ductus/` tier, so a *converged* adopter fell
#     through to the default spec root and enumerated the wrong tree;
#   * the hook guarded the runtime on `command -v ductus` while spec 048 had
#     moved it into the store, which is never on `PATH`;
#   * the hook's staged-spec detection hardcoded `specs`, so on a non-default
#     `[paths] specs-root` (spec 040) nothing was re-staged and every commit
#     landed with frontmatter the generators had already superseded on disk.
#
# None was reachable by grep: each is a *behavior* that only appears when the
# shell runs against a tree shaped like an adopter's. So this family builds
# such trees and runs the real shipped hooks in them: the inner hook directly,
# and, for a project in a subdirectory of its repository (spec 059), the outer
# stub and the inner hook together through a real `git commit`.
#
# **What this family covers changed with spec 022's adopter-generator-promotion.**
# The two frontmatter derivations moved out of shell and into the
# `derive-dependencies` / `derive-references` primitives, which carry their own
# end-to-end golden tests (`runtime/tests/derive_*_golden.rs`). What remains
# shell — and therefore what this family owns — is the hook's *orchestration*:
# resolving the runtime through the pointer, halting when it is unreachable,
# scoping staged specs at any configured root, and re-staging what the
# primitives rewrote. The runtime is stubbed so the family stays hermetic (no
# `cargo build`, identical in CI and on a laptop); the stub simulates the
# derivation so the re-stage assertion still has a rewrite to catch.
#
# The fixtures are deliberately hostile to the masking conditions above:
#   * one run sets `[paths] specs-root = "features"`, where a hardcoded default
#     matches nothing (the others use the default, isolating everything else)
#   * config only at `.ductus/config.toml` — no legacy tier to fall back to
#   * the runtime reachable ONLY at `.ductus/bin/ductus`, nothing on `PATH`
#   * every fixture commit runs with the user's global and system git config
#     ignored, so a `commit.gpgsign` or a hook setting there cannot fail a case
#     for a reason that is not the shipped hook's
#
# Vacuity guard: every precondition failure is a finding, never a silent pass.
# A fixture that cannot be built is a family that did not run, and this file
# exists because checks that cannot run are what let the three defects ship.

# `set -euo pipefail` that turns the loop's own guard into a failure mode: an
# adopter carrying `[ -f "$f" ] && git add "$f"` as the body's *last* command
# gets exit 1 from the `&&` on every deleted spec, and the whole commit dies.
# `|| continue` avoids it, and does so without the `|| true` variant that would
# also swallow a genuine `git add` failure.
#
# This shape is not hypothetical and it is not grep-able: the hook reads
# correctly and the loop is only wrong for input this repo rarely produces.

# was looking at the deletion path, and nothing would have told them if the
# rewrite had kept the `&&`. A downstream project reported it on 2026-08-25,
# still running the pre-rename hook. So: exercise the deleted-spec path.
