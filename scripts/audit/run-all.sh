# scripts/audit/run-all.sh — `/audit` aggregator.
#
# Runs the check-zero precondition pass followed by the family check scripts
# registered below. Aggregates findings to stdout under per-family headers
# and exits 1 when any family (or check-zero) produced findings.
# Family numbers are stable identifiers: Family 3 (registry equivalence)
# was retired with the workflows feature (spec 043), leaving a gap.
#
# This script IS the implementation of `/audit`. The framework/commands/
# audit.md slash-command file is documentation that invokes this
# orchestrator via the runtime's `run-generator` primitive (single call,
# no per-step args needed — sidesteps the runtime parser's lack of
# per-step argument binding for procedural commands).

  # Findings go to stdout and are rendered under a per-family header when the
  # family fails. A family's **coverage notices go to stderr** and are passed
  # straight through in both cases, rather than being captured and discarded on
  # success as they were until 0.49.8.
  #
  # That capture made every coverage line invisible on exactly the runs they
  # exist for. Family 19 has closed each run with a line naming what it
  # examined since it shipped, Families 30 and 35 report their counts the same
  # way, and none of it ever reached an aggregated run — so a clean `run-all.sh`
  # printed nothing at all, which is indistinguishable from a run that never
  # executed. That is `QUAL-CLAIM-001` turned on this aggregator: the exit code
  # said "no findings" and nothing said what had been looked at. Surfaced by
  # Family 38, whose whole contract is a standing notice and which was silent
  # on every clean run until this was fixed.
  #
  # The exit-code contract is unchanged, so CI still gates on it without
  # parsing anything (spec 026 AC12).
