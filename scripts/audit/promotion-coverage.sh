#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/audit/promotion-coverage.sh — Family 38 of /audit.
#
# How much of AGENTS.md has been routed to the constitution, reported as a
# coverage line rather than as a gate.
#
# §drift-prevention's *Shared knowledge stays in git* routes a learning by
# population, and the first destination is the constitution. Nothing reported
# how much of AGENTS.md had actually gone there, and *not having promoted* is
# invisible by construction: a universal entry still sitting in AGENTS.md
# looks exactly like one correctly judged project-only, because neither
# carries a marker and a per-entry marker is the authored input
# §design-principles rejects.
#
# THE CHECK IS A PRIMITIVE; THIS IS THE ENTRY POINT. The counting lives in
# `check-promotion-coverage`, which reuses the tested comment- and
# fence-aware bullet grammar the inbox primitives already share. Re-deriving
# it here in awk or python would be a second implementation of markdown
# structure parsing — the thing §runtime-boundary principle 3 names.
#
# A NOTICE, NEVER A GATE, and the split is deliberate:
#
#   * the coverage line goes to stderr and never touches the exit code, which
#     is Family 19's existing shape. Promotion has to stay free for the reason
#     §brownfield-inbox gives for capture — gating the release audit on how
#     much is unrouted would make the honest choice between a growing backlog
#     and a silent one push toward silence.
#   * an unmatched table key IS a finding. It means the classification table
#     names an entry that no longer reads that way, so a recorded verdict
#     points at nothing: real drift between two artifacts, which is what
#     /audit is for. A lead-phrase key degrades loudly to not matching at all,
#     where a positional identifier would have degraded silently to matching
#     whichever entry later occupied its slot.
#   * a missing section IS a finding, because a denominator that quietly
#     shrinks when a section is renamed moves coverage in the flattering
#     direction.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-15: 121 rule-bearing across the four sections, 98 table
# rows all matched, 74 constitution-citing, 119 classified, 2 unclassified,
# 0 unmatched keys, 0 missing sections.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS system bash). The runtime emits JSON; python3
# renders tab-separated records and the shell renders those through `emit`,
# per the convention ./README.md records.
