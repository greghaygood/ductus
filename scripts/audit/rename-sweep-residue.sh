#
# 049 renamed the project with a word-boundary `govern` -> `ductus`
# substitution. `govern` was in use as both a noun (the project) and an
# ordinary English verb, and a word-boundary sweep cannot tell them apart: it
# renamed the noun correctly and replaced the verb with a proper noun, leaving
# sentences like "a class of behavior the framework should ductus at the rules
# tier".
#
# security-frontend.md shows the mechanism inside one sentence — "The other
# `FE-DEPS` rules ductus what code is loaded ... none governs what a dependency
# does" — where the inflected form survived only because it never matched the
# word boundary.
#
# NINE sites survived, not eight. Three ship to adopters, and one of those is
# framework/templates/project/agents.md, a `create`-strategy file: the broken
# sentence is written into a new adopter's AGENTS.md once and corrected by no
# later run. All 23 existing families were green throughout; the residue was
# found by an ad-hoc grep during an unrelated review.
#
# The ninth was framework/rules/api-backend.md, found 2026-09-15 and invisible
# to the original two classes by construction: it read "this rule and
# `BE-ERRENV-002` ductus its contract shape", which is the name followed by a
# POSSESSIVE DETERMINER rather than by a demonstrative or wh-word. It also
# ships to adopters. Until that repair this family exited 0 over 514 markdown
# files with live residue present, which is the shape it exists to prevent.
#
# DETECTION. Three constructions, all drawn from closed word classes, so this
# is exact rather than heuristic:
#
#   1. A modal + the project name. A modal is always followed by a bare
#      infinitive and the project name is a proper noun, so the pair cannot be
#      correct under any phrasing.
#   2. The project name + a demonstrative or wh-word. A proper noun does not
#      take one.
#   3. The project name + a possessive determiner. Same argument: a proper
#      noun does not take one, so the pair marks a verb slot.
#
# MEASURED. The two-class union reported 8 findings at the commit before the
# original repair and 0 after — true of what it could see, and an undercount
# of the corpus, which is why "exactly the 8 real sites, no others" no longer
# stands. Calibrated on recall over known-true instances rather than on a
# count: at 9da4a7ae^ the verb took a possessive exactly once (`govern its`,
# the api-backend.md site) and `their`/`our`/`your`/`his`/`her` zero times.
#
# WHY THE WHOLE POSSESSIVE CLASS, on one instance. The existing lists are
# grammar-calibrated, not frequency-calibrated: measured at 9da4a7ae^, three
# of the seven followers (`whether`, `these`, `those`) and seven of the eight
# modals had zero instances and are listed anyway, because the closed word
# class is the argument. Listing only `its` would break that precedent and
# leave the next sweep's plural uncovered.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than implied. A ditransitive sentence — "give
# ductus its due", "grant ductus their place" — puts a possessive after the
# name legitimately and would be reported. That is the trade the DELIBERATE
# EXCLUSIONS below refuse for `the`/`to`/`that`, and it is accepted here on
# measurement: the construction appears 0 times across the 584 tracked
# markdown files (2026-09-15), where "a change to ductus" and "stripped of
# ductus the same commit" are both common. If one is ever written, quote it or
# reword it rather than widening the exclusions.
#
# DELIBERATE EXCLUSIONS. `the` is absent from the second list: "with `PATH`
# stripped of ductus the same commit succeeds" is correct prose. `to ductus`
# and `that ductus` are absent for the same reason — "a change to ductus" and
# "the version that ductus pins" are ordinary. Each would trade a real finding
# for a standing false positive.
#
# `my` is excluded from the possessive class on the same test, and it is the
# one member measured to fail it: README.md documents adoption as
# "/ductus my-project", so the name is followed by `my` in correct prose on
# the project's front page. Caught by probing the narrowed direction before
# shipping the widening, not by reasoning about it; `govern my` also occurs
# zero times at 9da4a7ae^, so excluding it costs no recall.
#
# A degenerate scan — no files examined — is a finding, never a pass. A
# corpus-wide grep that matches nothing is otherwise indistinguishable from a
# clean corpus. See AGENTS.md §Design Principles.
#
# Bash 3.2 compatible (macOS system bash); POSIX grep only, no awk extensions
# (the portability trap that made Family 7 dead on macOS).
