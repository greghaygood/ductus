//! The tier counts an exec `/{project}:analyze` walk records (spec 058, AC26).
//!
//! Interactively, the host tallies each detection step's findings into the
//! tier counts `write-analysis` records, by the tier each step assigns. The
//! exec walker has no host to do that, and its `write-analysis` dispatch once
//! bound no counts at all, so every exec record read 0/0/0 and fully examined
//! whatever detection had found: a clean result standing in for an unexamined
//! one, the conflation `QUAL-CLAIM-001` forbids. This is that tally, and the
//! `unexamined-by-reason` breakdown beside it: what the walk did not examine,
//! including the detection it never runs.
//!
//! It is taken at dispatch rather than read back from the walker context,
//! because the context merges results by bare key and several steps answer
//! under the same one (`findings`), each overwriting the last. Nothing is
//! itemized, so `write-analysis` counts every live finding undispositioned —
//! the walker has no operator to decide one.
//!
//! Each arm restates the tier its step in `framework/commands/analyze.md`
//! assigns, and each unexamined reason the class that file's Unexamined
//! targets section gives it. The procedure is the authority: a step whose
//! tiering changes changes here in the same commit.
