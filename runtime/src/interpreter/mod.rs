//! Procedure walker and JSON-over-stdio protocol I/O.
//!
//! [`Walker`] is the synchronous engine that consumes a parsed
//! [`Procedure`] step by step. For each step it either:
//!
//! - Dispatches to a primitive's pure-Rust function, merges its structured
//!   result into the walker context (so a later step's payload builder or a
//!   later primitive can read prior results), and emits a `progress`
//!   envelope (`Step::Primitive`). See [`Walker::merge_primitive_result`]
//!   for the merge policy.
//! - Emits an `llm-request` envelope and reads a matching
//!   `llm-response` from stdin (`Step::Extension`). An `assessSpecQuality`
//!   step emits one per loaded rule of its tier, each carrying one rule
//!   (spec 060), and an `askClarifyQuestion` step one per open question;
//!   every other extension step emits exactly one.
//! - Blocks on a confirmation gate: emits a `gate-confirm` envelope and
//!   reads a `gate-response` back. A denied gate is a clean `complete`
//!   (per §partial-failure-semantics), never an error.
//! - Otherwise no-op (`Step::Prose`).
//!
//! # Gate convention
//!
//! Two step shapes gate, and step type decides which rule applies:
//!
//! - A `Step::Primitive` whose name is `gate-confirm` IS a blocking gate
//!   by virtue of the primitive — phrase or no phrase (prune.md step 4's
//!   shape). The walker emits the `gate-confirm` envelope itself and
//!   awaits the `gate-response`; it does not dispatch through
//!   [`dispatch_primitive`].
//! - A `Step::Prose` whose text contains the phrase "ask the user to
//!   approve" (case-insensitive, [`GATE_TRIGGER`]) is a fallback gate for
//!   procedures that gate without the primitive (plan.md / specify.md's
//!   shape).
//!
//! Dispatch wins over the phrase: a non-gate `Step::Primitive` or a
//! `Step::Extension` whose prose happens to contain the phrase dispatches
//! normally — a step is never silently converted into a gate that drops
//! its primitive or extension dispatch.
//!
//! At the end of the procedure the walker emits `complete`. Operational
//! errors halt the walk and emit an `error` envelope before returning.
//! Step ordering and message emission are deterministic given the same
//! procedure + inputs. While suspended awaiting an `llm-response` or
//! `gate-response`, any other inbound line — a wrong-type envelope, a
//! response with a mismatched request-id, malformed JSON, or a blank
//! keepalive — is logged to stderr and skipped, and the walker keeps
//! waiting (data-model §JSON-over-stdio ignore-and-continue rule). Only
//! stdin EOF while awaiting a response is an operational error.
