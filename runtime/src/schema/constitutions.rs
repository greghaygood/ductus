//! `[constitutions]` registry schema from `.ductus/config.toml`.
//!
//! A shared constitution (spec 055) is a governance document an organization
//! owns, registered here so every one of its projects loads the same rules
//! instead of retyping them. The registry mirrors [`crate::schema::services`]
//! deliberately: `repo` is identity and navigation only and is **never
//! fetched**, and the local `path` is the only state read. This module is the
//! pure shape, its parser, and the value validation the registry's schema
//! declares; file IO and outcome classification live in the
//! `resolve-constitutions` primitive.
//!
//! **Validation runs inside [`Constitutions::from_toml_str`], not beside it.**
//! A separate `validate()` a caller had to remember to invoke would be the
//! diligence dependency the constitution's §design-principles rejects — and
//! the failure would be silent, since an unvalidated registry resolves
//! perfectly well and simply answers wrongly. Routing it through the one
//! constructor makes a `Constitutions` built from a config document validated
//! by construction.
//!
//! Schema is canonical in `specs/055-shared-constitution/data-model.md`; the
//! severities are canonical in `framework/bootstrap/ductus.md` §Validating the
//! registry, which this module mirrors rather than restates.
