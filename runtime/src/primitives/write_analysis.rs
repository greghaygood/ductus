//! `write-analysis` — record that `/ductus:analyze` ran, by writing
//! `specs/NNN/analysis.md`: the record in its frontmatter, the findings in a
//! fixed body skeleton. `spec.md` is not written (spec 057).
//!
//! The pipeline is `implement → review → analyze → done`, and until this
//! primitive existed only half of it left a trace. `check-review-gate` read
//! the `review:` block; Family 19 checked its freshness; Family 31 held it
//! against `review.md`. Analyze wrote nothing, so a spec that had passed both
//! gates and a spec that had passed only the first were **byte-identical on
//! disk**. Nothing could tell them apart, which meant nothing could enforce
//! the second gate, which meant the only thing holding it was whoever
//! remembered — the diligence dependency §design-principles rejects outright.
//!
//! That state was not hypothetical. On 2026-09-05 two specs were advanced to
//! `done` on the review gate alone and one of them was published to crates.io
//! before anyone noticed, because there was nothing to notice: every signal
//! the repository had said the spec was complete. The gap was found by being
//! asked, which is the definition of a diligence dependency.
//!
//! **Recording that the audit happened is not mutating the subject** — it is
//! precisely what `write-review` does for the other gate, and precisely why
//! that gate was enforceable and this one was not. Detection stays read-only;
//! the fix-and-route step that follows it writes only with the operator's
//! per-write confirmation, and this record is written after that step and a
//! re-check, so it describes the state after dispositions (spec 058).
//!
//! Every finding arrives with its disposition, and the record counts them
//! under `dispositions:`. The tier counts stay host-supplied scalars from the
//! re-check, and `undispositioned` is derived as the live tier total minus the
//! live findings routed or discarded — so a finding the caller does not
//! itemize, including every finding on the exec path, is counted as owed.
//! Nothing is written to the inbox.
//!
//! The block deliberately is **not** a copy of `review:`:
//!
//! - `advisory` is recorded and never gated on. An outstanding SHOULD blocks
//!   `done` at the review gate because §implement-phase says advisory is not
//!   ignorable there. Analyze's advisory tier is advisory by design: some of
//!   its checks were introduced advisory *with published promotion criteria*
//!   — grounding, Applicable-Rules citations, decision drift — and the rest,
//!   the plan record and un-folded branch specs among them, stay advisory for
//!   good. Gating on them here would promote every one of them at once, past
//!   the criteria some declare and against the design of the rest.
//! - `unexamined` has no counterpart in `review:` at all, and is the field
//!   that makes this record honest. A clean analyze is two states, not one,
//!   and the command's own contract says so: "clean with nothing skipped is
//!   verified-clean, clean with something skipped is partially examined." A
//!   record carrying only finding counts would collapse that into the
//!   reassuring reading — inside the artifact a later gate trusts, which is
//!   the worst possible place for `QUAL-CLAIM-001`.
//!
//! Defined by `specs/047-analyze-findings-durability/scenarios/analyze-run-durability.md`.
