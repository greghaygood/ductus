//! `check-promotion-coverage` — how much of a rules file has been routed to
//! the canonical source it belongs in.
//!
//! [§drift-prevention](../../../framework/constitution.md#drift-prevention)'s
//! *Shared knowledge stays in git* routes a learning by **population**, and
//! the first destination is the constitution. Nothing reported how much of the
//! rules file had actually gone there — and *not having promoted* is invisible
//! by construction, because a universal entry still sitting in the project's
//! own file looks exactly like one correctly judged project-only. Both are
//! bullets in the same section, and neither carries a marker, since a
//! per-entry marker is the authored input §design-principles rejects.
//!
//! The measurement needs no authored input at all:
//!
//! ```text
//! unclassified = rule-bearing − (table-keyed ∪ pointer-citing)
//! ```
//!
//! **Why a primitive rather than a hand derivation.** The figure has been
//! re-derived by hand repeatedly and disagreed with itself every time, and not
//! once was the cause decay — each disagreement was a difference of *method*.
//! Counting the pointer side as anchor-bearing lines in the whole file rather
//! than as rule-bearing bullets in the named sections gives two honest answers
//! to one question; and a matcher that does not strip a trailing parenthetical
//! from a table key fails to match every key carrying one, reporting a
//! coverage gap that is an artifact of the instrument. Both were caught only
//! because someone happened to re-derive a second time. A recorded figure
//! decays and a hand method drifts; this does neither, which is why all four
//! terms are reported rather than just the difference.
//!
//! **A notice, never a gate** (spec 022, scenario `the-promotion-coverage-line`).
//! Promotion has to stay free for the reason §brownfield-inbox gives for
//! capture: gating a release on how much is unrouted would make the honest
//! choice between a growing backlog and a silent one push toward silence.
