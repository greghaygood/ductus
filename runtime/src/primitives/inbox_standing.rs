//! The **standing** inbox backlog — how deep the queue is and how old its
//! oldest item is — rendered by `dashboard` as `/{project}:status`'s `Inbox:`
//! line.
//!
//! It began as the other half of a pair. `write-review` and `diff-cross-spec`
//! each showed a **window** — the bullets captured while the feature in hand
//! was open — and a window cannot show an item older than that feature: six
//! stood in the inbox when `ductus-v0.47.0` was cut, and they appeared in that
//! feature's reports only because all six happened to land inside its window
//! (spec 022, scenario `the-inbox-row`). Spec 058 retired the windows along
//! with the capture that fed them — no finding a run produces reaches the
//! inbox now — and moved this row to `dashboard`, because a count of the
//! todos a person has logged has no bearing on the spec a review or
//! implementation run is working on.
//!
//! **A notice, never a gate.** §brownfield-inbox keeps capture free — *"the
//! honest choice between a growing backlog and a silent one would otherwise
//! push toward silence"* — so gating `done` or a release on inbox depth would
//! make logging a todo expensive. The row changes what the operator knows at
//! the moment they decide, and withholds nothing.

/// tree and the blame from `HEAD`, so pairing them by position shifted every
/// bullet below an uncommitted removal onto the line above it — right after
/// `/{project}:groom`, the row reported the removed item's date. Blaming the
/// working-tree bytes as a buffer fixed that and broke two other cases: under
/// `core.autocrlf` the working file is CRLF and the blob LF, so every line
/// read as uncommitted, and libgit2's buffer blame misplaces a deletion that
/// follows an insertion (spec 058). A text match is immune to both: a trailing
/// `\r` is trimmed on each side, a line whose text `HEAD` does not hold is
/// uncommitted and carries no date (it is newer than every committed line, so
/// it cannot be the oldest), and repeated texts pair in file order.
///
/// A **shallow clone** attributes every line older than its cut to the
/// boundary commit, whose date is then a confident answer for lines it did
/// not write, so a boundary hunk carries no date there. In a full clone the
/// boundary is the root commit and its date is real. The blamed path is
/// relative to the git work tree, which is not the project root when the
/// project lives in a subdirectory of its repository.
///
/// `None` when it cannot be determined — no repository, a file not yet
/// committed, every bullet uncommitted or behind a shallow cut, a blame that
/// fails for any other reason. That is reported as *undeterminable* by the
/// caller rather than silently dropped or defaulted to today. **This reads git
/// history**, so a CI job running it needs `fetch-depth: 0`
