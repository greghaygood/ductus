//! `fetch-archive` — download an archive and, optionally, verify its
//! sha256 against a sidecar file.
//!
//! The procedural use case is the `/ductus` bootstrap installer
//! (scenario `ductus-bootstrap` on spec 022). The bootstrap fetches
//! GitHub's auto-generated source tarball at the ref its run resolved
//! (`codeload.github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tar.gz/{archive-ref}`, spec 061),
//! which has no companion sha256 sidecar on any ref. Other procedural
//! callers (release-asset installers, future runtime auto-update) do
//! have sidecars and want verification.
//!
//! Behavior:
//!
//! - `sha256_url = Some(_)`: download the archive, fetch the sidecar,
//!   parse its leading hex token, compare against the computed sha. A
//!   mismatch raises [`PrimitiveError::ChecksumMismatch`] *before* the
//!   archive is written — nothing lands on disk. The error's `path`
//!   names the destination the archive would have been written to
//!   (kept for message compatibility and retry context); that file is
//!   never created.
//! - `sha256_url = None`: download the archive, compute the sha256,
//!   return it in the result with `verified: false`. The host can
//!   compare against a known-good digest out-of-band if it cares.
//!
//! Either way the result includes the computed digest and a
//! `verified: bool` so the host knows whether to trust it.
//!
//! Response bodies are capped at `MAX_FETCH_BYTES`. A body that exceeds
//! the cap raises an operational error naming the cap and the archive is
//! not written — never a silent truncation, which would otherwise carry
//! a self-consistent computed sha and only surface as corruption later
//! in `extract-archive`. A body of exactly the cap size succeeds.
//!
//! The primitive is blocking — it spins reqwest's blocking client per
//! call rather than dragging an async runtime through the primitive
//! surface. Network failures map to [`PrimitiveError::Http`] (transport)
//! or [`PrimitiveError::HttpStatus`] (non-2xx).
//!
//! Outbound requests are guarded against SSRF before a connection is
//! opened ([`validate_fetch_url`]): the scheme is allowlisted to `https`
//! (which also satisfies the transport-encryption rule), and the host is
//! resolved with `std::net` so every candidate address can be screened —
//! any URL resolving to a loopback, link-local (including the
//! `169.254.169.254` cloud-metadata endpoint), RFC-1918 private,
//! unique-local, or unspecified address is rejected. IPv4-mapped IPv6
//! addresses are unwrapped so a `::ffff:127.0.0.1` literal cannot smuggle
//! an internal target past the v4 screen.
//!
//! The HTTP client reads no environment variable per fetch (`CFG-ENV-001`;
//! spec 048, scenario `fetch-archive-reads-its-proxy-once`). The proxy
//! variables are captured once at startup ([`init_proxy_env`]) and applied as
//! explicit proxies, which turns off reqwest's own per-build read of them. On
//! Linux and other non-Apple Unix, where the certificate verifier would read
//! `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` on every build, the system roots are
//! loaded once, at the process's first fetch, and handed to every build.
//!
//! **Through a proxy, the operator's proxy is the trust boundary.** The
//! screen above still runs on the first URL and every redirect hop, so
//! nothing it refuses is fetched through a proxy. A direct connection — no
//! proxy set, or a host `NO_PROXY` names — stays pinned to the screened
//! addresses. A proxied one is not: reqwest sends the hostname in its
//! `CONNECT`, the proxy resolves it, and what it resolves and reaches is the
//! policy of the operator who configured it.
//!
//! The sidecar format matches `shasum -a 256` output: one or more lines
//! shaped `<hex>  <filename>`. Only the first hex digest is consulted;
//! filename column is informational.
