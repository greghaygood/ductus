//! Stored finding decisions — the `decisions:` list both audit records carry
//! beside their counts (spec 058).
//!
//! A finding routed or discarded in one run fires again in the next, because
//! detection is stateless: a routed finding keeps firing until the routed work
//! lands, and a discarded one keeps firing forever. Without a stored decision
//! every re-run would ask again, and a routed finding would come back
//! undispositioned and block `done` again. So each routed or discarded
//! decision is stored in the record of the command that made it, and a later
//! run counts a matching finding under the stored outcome without asking.
//!
//! The lifecycle mirrors review waivers (`framework/commands/review.md`,
//! §Per-run waiver processing): matched while the key fires, expired when an
//! unrestricted run no longer produces it, retained when the run did not
//! evaluate its source. A malformed entry is reported and never pruned.
