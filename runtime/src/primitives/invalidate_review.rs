//! `invalidate-review` — mark a spec's recorded review as no longer
//! describing the spec.
//!
//! The pre-`done` gate asks two questions of the `review:` block: has a
//! review run at all, and does the recorded one still describe the current
//! code. The second is answered by diffing the spec's **durable contracts**
//! — `scenarios/*.md` and `data-model.md` — between `reviewed-against` and
//! `HEAD`. `spec.md` is deliberately outside that set, because a spec body
//! is not what a review reads.
//!
//! That leaves one case the staleness check cannot see: a fold-back
//! (spec 051) that routes a branch-scoped spec's content into the upstream
//! spec's **body**. Only `spec.md` changes, no durable contract moves, and
//! the upstream spec can return to `done` carrying a review that never saw
//! the code the fold brought with it. The fold knows what the diff cannot,
//! so it says so here rather than leaving the gate to infer it.
//!
//! **Waivers survive.** An invalidation says the review is out of date; it
//! does not withdraw an operator's recorded judgement about a finding, and
//! silently dropping one would make a MUST re-block with the reasoning for
//! accepting it gone.
//!
//! Converges on a re-run: a spec with no current review is
//! `invalidated: false`, a domain outcome rather than an error, so an
//! interrupted fold completes by being run again (spec 051, AC24, AC29).
