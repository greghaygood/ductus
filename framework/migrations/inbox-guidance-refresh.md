# inbox-guidance-refresh

**Introduced in:** ductus 0.53.0
**Summary:** Replace the guidance comment at the top of an existing inbox with the current template's, which documents manual capture only — no command writes findings there any more. Every item is left byte-identical.

## Background

`specs/inbox.md` is installed once, with the `create` strategy (`framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`, **Shared Files**), and nothing rewrites it afterwards — so an adopter's inbox keeps the guidance comment it was first installed with. Before spec 058 that comment documented three item forms, two of them written by machines: findings `/review`, `/analyze`, and `/implement` captured automatically, and rule gaps the `/ductus` adoption audit wrote. After 058 no command writes to the inbox on its own. Every finding is fixed, routed, or discarded in the run that found it ([§brownfield-inbox](../constitution.md#brownfield-inbox), Finding dispositions), and the inbox holds only what a person logs with `/{project}:log`. A header still describing automatic capture tells its next reader the opposite of what the pipeline does.

This migration rewrites the guidance and nothing else. **Items are never touched** — including items captured automatically before this change, which stay until `/{project}:groom` walks them through the same five routes as a logged one. [Spec 058](../../specs/058-findings-route-at-discovery/spec.md) governs.

## Procedure

1. **Resolve the inbox.** Read `[paths] specs-root` from the active config file (default `specs`); the inbox is `{specs-root}/inbox.md`. When it does not exist, there is nothing to refresh: report `inbox-guidance-refresh: no {specs-root}/inbox.md — nothing to do` and stop. Do not create one — the Shared Files manifest installs the inbox, not a migration.

2. **Idempotency check.** Locate the guidance comment: the first HTML comment whose opening line begins `<!-- Rules:`, running to the first `-->` after it. Compare that span, `<!--` through `-->` inclusive, with the same span in the current `framework/templates/project/inbox.md` from the acquired archive, normalizing line endings to `\n` for the comparison only. When they are equal **and** the text between the `# Inbox` heading and the comment is not the pre-058 introduction quoted in step 5, the inbox is converged: report `inbox-guidance-refresh: guidance already current` and stop without writing.

   A file with **no** `<!-- Rules:` comment is converged too, and is left alone: its owner removed or replaced the guidance, and a migration must not reinstate what an adopter chose to drop. Report `inbox-guidance-refresh: no guidance comment in {specs-root}/inbox.md — left as is` and stop.

3. **Skip a pinned inbox.** When `{specs-root}/inbox.md` is listed in `.ductus/config.toml` `[pinned] files`, write nothing and report one line — pinning opts a file out of framework writes, and this is one:

   `warning: {specs-root}/inbox.md is pinned; leaving its guidance comment — copy the comment from framework/templates/project/inbox.md by hand if you want it refreshed.`

4. **Replace the comment, and only the comment.** Substitute the template's comment for the span step 2 located. Everything outside that span is preserved exactly: the heading, any text between the heading and the comment (except as step 5 allows), and every item below it — including items in the forms the new guidance no longer documents. A comment an adopter edited is replaced as well: the comment is framework guidance, the migration cannot tell a customization from an older shipped version, and git history keeps the old text. **Preserve the file's line endings**: when the file uses `\r\n`, write the new comment's lines with `\r\n`, and never normalize the rest of the file. Write atomically — a temporary file in the same directory, then a rename.

5. **Refresh the introduction only when it is the shipped one.** The pre-058 template carried an introductory paragraph between the heading and the comment, describing issues "captured incidentally during work". When the text between the `# Inbox` heading and the comment is exactly that paragraph (line endings normalized for the comparison only), replace it with the current template's introduction, under step 4's line-ending rule and in the same atomic write. When it differs in any way — the adopter wrote their own, or removed it — leave it untouched: a customized introduction is the adopter's. The pre-058 paragraph, verbatim:

   ```text
   Capture queue for issues not yet assigned to a feature spec — both the
   brownfield-adoption backlog and issues captured incidentally during work.
   Items are migrated to their proper home by `/groom` (see the constitution,
   §brownfield-inbox).
   ```

6. **Report** one line naming what changed — `inbox-guidance-refresh: refreshed the guidance comment` or `inbox-guidance-refresh: refreshed the guidance comment and the introduction` — and the item count, unchanged, so the operator can see that nothing below the header moved.

## Verification

- The inbox's items — every `-` list item outside an HTML comment, the grammar the inbox primitives use — are byte-identical before and after, in the same order.
- `git diff` over the inbox shows changes inside the guidance comment, and at most the shipped introduction, and nowhere else.
- The file's line endings are unchanged.
- A second run reports `guidance already current` and writes nothing.
