# 061 — Updates track the latest release tag Plan

Implements [061 — Updates track the latest release tag](spec.md).

## Overview

The change is almost entirely in the bootstrap's pre-flight and in the installer. A new **Source resolution** step opens the Pre-flight Phase. It settles the run's one ref: from `--ref`, else the recorded `[source] ref`, else the latest release. It validates that ref against the grammar, existence, and both floors, and fetches the version pin at it. Everything afterwards — runtime acquisition, the recorded choice, the self-update check, the archive fetch — reads the ref from there. The archive's extracted root is derived from the extraction instead of being spelled `ductus-main/`.

The installer gains the same flag and the same latest-release resolution. It becomes a release asset, uploaded by the job that already owns the release upload.

The runtime needs no behavior change. `fetch-archive` already takes any URL (`runtime/src/schema/primitives.rs:2468`), and `extract-archive` already returns every extracted path (`runtime/src/schema/primitives.rs:2446`). The one runtime edit is a doc comment. The release that ships this spec is nonetheless required, because the spec's first resolved question makes a release the only way a framework change reaches default-source adopters.

The rest is the prose-claim sweep and the discharge of nine declared cross-spec impacts, one reopen cycle each.

## Technical Decisions

### Source resolution runs host-side, first in pre-flight

The ref has to be known before the first fetch back into this repository. That first fetch is the version pin, and the runtime is acquired *from* the pin (`framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`, Runtime acquisition Branch 2 step 1). So resolution cannot be a runtime primitive: on a first run, State B, no runtime exists yet, and which runtime to acquire is exactly what resolution decides. It is host-side `curl`, like the two pre-flight fetches it replaces. Neither of those is primitive-backed, and both run as shown in every state (`framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`, State A, "Steps with no backticked primitive run as shown in every state").

The new subsection sits between the `{tempdir}` creation and **ductus runtime detection**. It runs these steps in order, and nothing that depends on the source is written until the last one:

1. **Read the inputs.** Read `--ref` from `$ARGUMENTS` (§Inputs gains the flag). Read the recorded `[source] ref`, `[migrations] last_applied` and `[runtime] path` from the active config file. A malformed config file already aborts at read (`framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`, §Project Configuration). Resolution reads it earlier than any other step did, so that rule now fires here.
2. **Check the grammar.** `--ref` given more than once halts. So does a value, from the flag or from the record, that is not `latest`, `main`, or `ductus-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`. Precedence is flag, then record, then default.
3. **Resolve `latest`.** `curl -sSI https://github.com/stonean/ductus/releases/latest`, without `-L`. The tag is the last path segment of the `Location` header after `/releases/tag/`. A response without a `Location`, or a tag outside `ductus-v<SemVer>`, halts, naming the URL and what came back.
4. **Check the release floor.** A resolved tag below `{ref-floor}` halts. `{ref-floor}` is a constant: the first release that carries this spec.
5. **Fetch the pin at the ref.** `raw.githubusercontent.com/stonean/ductus/{raw-ref}/version`. On a named tag a 404 means the tag does not exist, and the run halts naming it. This fetch is the existence check, so a named tag costs no extra request, and the pin is fetched once per run rather than once per check.
6. **Check the migration floor** (tags only; see below).
7. **Report the source**: one line naming the source, where it came from (`--ref`, recorded, or default), and the ref it resolved to. It is emitted here so that a run which later halts or aborts still says which release it was on (AC5).

**Runtime acquisition Branch 2 step 1 stops fetching the pin.** It reads the one resolution fetched. This also retires the paragraph that justified two fetches agreeing "only because both name `main`".

### The ref is recorded after acquisition, before the self-update check

`--ref=main` or a tag is written as a `# ductus (source)` line-prefix managed block. The block holds a `[source]` table in the active config file, written with `merge-managed-block`, as the `[host]` block is (`framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`, §Instructions step 6). The primitive appends a new block at the end of the file (`runtime/src/primitives/merge_managed_block.rs:28`). A trailing TOML table cannot capture another table's keys, so appending is safe.

The write happens right after **ductus runtime detection**, because that is the first point at which the primitive is reachable in both states: over MCP in State A, and through `{pointer-path}` in State B. It happens before the **Self-update check**. The self-update's stale path aborts pre-flight, and the re-run that follows must read the choice from the record. Otherwise it would resolve the default and replace the bootstrap again, which is the flip-flop the spec's persistence answer exists to prevent.

`merge-managed-block` has no remove action. So `--ref=latest` rewrites an existing block as a bare `[source]` table with no `ref` key, which reads as the default. With no block present, `--ref=latest` writes nothing, which is the spec's edge case. A runtime removal action was considered and not taken (Trade-offs).

### One ref, three URL forms

The Derived paths table (`framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`, §Derived paths) gains three values:

| Name | `main` | a tag `T` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{raw-ref}` | `main` | `T` |
| `{archive-ref}` | `refs/heads/main` | `refs/tags/T` |
| `{source-label}` | `main` | `T`, with "latest release" or "recorded" noted from its origin |

The pin, the self-update fetch and the archive fetch are written against them:

- `raw.githubusercontent.com/stonean/ductus/{raw-ref}/version`
- `raw.githubusercontent.com/stonean/ductus/{raw-ref}/framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`
- `codeload.github.com/stonean/ductus/tar.gz/{archive-ref}`

The latest release is resolved once, so a release published during the run cannot split it (spec, *One run, one source*).

### The framework root is derived from the extraction, not predicted

GitHub names the archive's top directory after the ref: `ductus-main/` for `main`, and `ductus-ductus-v0.54.2/` for that tag (probed 2026-09-28). The naming rule is GitHub's, not this project's. Rather than restate it, `{framework-root}` is **the single top-level directory the archive extracted to**. On the runtime path it is the first path component of `extract-archive`'s `files`. On the markdown path it is the one directory `tar` created. Zero or several top-level directories halt, with the existing fetch-or-extract message.

This replaces the literal `ductus-main/` at every occurrence: six in `framework/bootstrap/ductus.md` and two in `framework/bootstrap/ductus-procedure.md`, counted with `git grep -c`.

### The migration floor reads two small registries

`[migrations] last_applied` holds a migration **id**, not a version (`framework/bootstrap/ductus-procedure.md`, §Pre-run Migrations step 2), and the registry mapping ids to `introduced_in` ships only in the archive. Pre-flight runs before the archive, so it fetches `framework/migrations.toml` at the resolved tag:

- **The id is present** in the tag's registry: the tag knows that migration, so it is not older than it. Pass.
- **The id is absent**, so fetch `main`'s registry. Registry entries are appended, and removed only when they sunset.
  - **Present at `main`**: the migration was added after the tag. Halt, naming the tag and the migration's `introduced_in`.
  - **Absent at `main` too**: the migration has been retired, so the project's layout predates every live entry. Pass, as §Pre-run Migrations' stale-reference behavior already treats a retired id.

A null `last_applied` passes, and on the `main` source the check is skipped entirely. The `main` registry read is a validation lookup, not a source fetch. Nothing in the run's content comes from it, so *One run, one source* is not touched. Only the target tag's registry cannot tell a migration newer than the tag from a retired one, and those two need opposite answers.

### Both floors apply to any resolved tag, not only a named one

The spec states the floors for a named tag. They are needed for `latest` too:

- A project on `main` can apply a migration no release carries yet. Returning it with `--ref=latest` would move it below that migration.
- Between this spec landing on `main` and its release being published, `main`'s bootstrap resolves `latest` to a release below `{ref-floor}`. Proceeding would place a bootstrap that fetches `main`, and the next run would replace it again.

The plan pass edits the spec's Failure behavior to say *a resolved tag*, and adds a criterion for the latest-release case, AC17. It does not rewrite AC10, whose meaning a rewrite would change.

### `{ref-floor}` is a constant written in two places

The floor is the version of the release that carries this spec. The plan assumes `0.55.0`, the next minor after `ductus-v0.54.2`, because the spec adds a user-facing flag. That is an assumption, and the implementing task writes the version actually cut. The floor appears in `framework/bootstrap/ductus.md` and in `install.sh`. Once that release exists it never changes, so the two copies cannot drift afterwards. Until then they can, so Family 14 (`scripts/audit/installer-registry-parity.sh`), which already parses both files, gains an assertion that they agree.

### The self-update check names its source

The upstream fetch uses `{raw-ref}`. The stale notice becomes: *The ductus command itself has updated from `{source-label}`*. Its closing *re-run* line is unchanged: once the ref is recorded, a plain re-run resolves the same source (AC14).

### Installer

`install.sh` gains a POSIX argument loop:

- The first non-flag word is the agent, defaulting to `claude` as now.
- `--ref=<value>` is accepted in any position. A repeated `--ref`, or an unknown `--` flag, halts.

The `case "$agent"` arms and their `dest=` assignments stay byte-identical, because Family 14 parses them (`scripts/audit/installer-registry-parity.sh`, header).

Resolution follows the bootstrap's rules:

- The grammar check.
- `latest` from the `Location` header.
- `{ref-floor}` through a small POSIX SemVer comparison.
- Existence through the bootstrap fetch itself, at `raw.githubusercontent.com/stonean/ductus/{raw-ref}/framework/bootstrap/ductus.md`. A 404 on a named tag halts naming it.

All of it happens before the payload verification the installer already does, so nothing is written for a bad ref. The migration floor and a recorded `[source] ref` are not checked: the installer reads no project configuration (spec, Edge Cases). The next `/ductus` run applies both. The plan pass corrects the spec's Installer sentence, which said the failure behavior applies *unchanged*.

When `--ref` was given, the completion message names `/ductus --ref=<value>` as the next command (AC13). The header comment's *live-on-main, no release-pinning knob* claim is replaced. The installer's own seeds already allow the `curl` it issues: `Bash(curl *)` for Claude, and the `^curl` matchers for the others (`install.sh` settings arms).

### The installer ships as a release asset

`scripts/lint-release-ordering.sh` allows only `release-assets` to carry the release-upload action (its rule 2), so the installer is attached there:

1. A checkout step at the tag.
2. A copy of `install.sh` into `staged/`.
3. An assertion in *Assert the asset set is complete* that the installer is present.
4. `staged/install.sh` added to the upload's `files`.

A job after `release-assets` then fetches `releases/download/<tag>/install.sh` and compares it byte-for-byte with the tag's copy. That makes AC12 machine-checked on every release, rather than resting on the first adopter who runs the one-liner. The lint's rule 3 requires *some* job after `release-assets` to exercise acquisition. The new job is an addition beside `verify-published`, and the lint's test is re-run.

### Documentation, release procedure, and the retired path

- **README.** Both one-liners become `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/stonean/ductus/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh`. `-L` follows GitHub's redirect to its asset host, in the user's shell: two `302`s, to `releases/download/<tag>/<asset>` and then to `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` (probed 2026-09-28, spec, installer Resolved Question). *Installing (per agent)* describes the release default and `--ref`.
- **`CLAUDE.md` and the `AGENTS.md` Workflow entry.** They keep *commit directly to `main`*, with the reason restated: releases are cut from `main` by tag.
- **The `AGENTS.md` release entry (AC15).** It states that a framework-only change reaches default-source adopters at the next `ductus-v*` release and bumps like any other release. Its *the commit is what breaks them* paragraph is restated too. The pin is now read at the resolved ref, so a version bump on `main` ahead of its tag halts only projects on `--ref=main`. A default-source project reads a pin from a release that was created only after its asset set was complete.
- **Family 36** (`scripts/audit/self-url-resolution.sh`) derives the repository slug from a `github.com/<owner>/<repo>/archive/` URL in the bootstrap (lines 80–90), and its comment restates *live-on-main*. The derivation moves to the `codeload.github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tar.gz/` form the bootstrap actually fetches, the comment is restated, and the family's line in `framework/commands/audit.md` follows.
- **Family 21.** `framework/bootstrap/govern.md` stays byte-identical to `ductus.md`, as Family 21 requires (`scripts/audit/transitional-bootstrap-parity.sh`). Old `/govern` installs still fetch it from `main`: that URL is compiled into bootstraps already installed, so it is out of this spec's reach. They then run the new bootstrap, which defaults to the latest release.

### Rollout: the bootstrap reaches `origin` only together with its release

Two things break if `framework/bootstrap/ductus.md` or the README one-liner reaches `origin/main` ahead of the release that carries them:

- Every adopter's existing bootstrap fetches `main`'s bootstrap and self-updates to it. The new bootstrap then resolves `latest` to `ductus-v0.54.2`, below `{ref-floor}`, and halts.
- The README one-liner 404s, because `ductus-v0.54.2` has no installer asset.

So the implementation is committed locally, the spec closes, and `main` is pushed together with the release tag in one sitting. That extends `AGENTS.md`'s *bump and tag in the same sitting* to the whole change. The window a published tag still leaves, roughly eleven minutes until the release exists (`AGENTS.md`, *A pushed tag is not a published release*), halts on the floor. Its message therefore says the release carrying this bootstrap may still be publishing, and that re-running shortly or passing `--ref=main` proceeds.

### Discharging nine declared impacts

Each of 003, 007, 015, 023, 026, 029, 048, 050 and 056 follows the 060-to-022 precedent (`6b7a0772`, `2dc4eb59`, `dba5175f`, `b4183757`). The steps are: `done → in-progress` in its own commit, then the corrected claims plus a `> **Signpost:**` blockquote linking back to 061, then a scoped review, an analyze, and `→ done`. The link sits in a blockquote so it induces no `dependencies:` edge (the `derive-dependencies` contract excludes blockquote-prefixed lines), and so no cycle with 061's own links to 003, 015 and 048.

The corrections, from the 2026-09-28 sweep:

- **003**: `curl-sh-installer` scenario lines 15 and 17.
- **007**: `ductus-self-update-precheck` line 23.
- **015**: spec lines 36, 39, 49, 51 and 61. Its Resolved Question deferring ref pinning is marked adopted (§drift-prevention, Decision resolution).
- **023**: the read-fallback Resolved Question's premise, noted as superseded. The decision itself stands.
- **026**: `family-36-self-url-resolution` line 24.
- **029**: `archive-fetch-direct-codeload` lines 9, 16 and 20.
- **048**:
  - spec line 59, and the *Version currency* cost the spec's store answer restates;
  - data-model line 18;
  - `pin-is-readable-when-acquisition-needs-it` lines 12 and 48;
  - the release asset set, which gains the installer.
- **050**: the Resolved Question at spec line 228.
- **056**: spec line 147.

The hits in these specs' `plan.md` and `tasks.md` are design records of how the work was done at the time. They stay, unless a line states current behavior as a present-tense fact, in which case it is corrected in the same reopen.

028 and 032 carry *live-on-main* only as a parenthetical descriptor. It is replaced by one uniform substitution, in its own commit, which is §spec-lifecycle case (a) and reopens neither.

## Trade-offs

- **A runtime primitive for source resolution.** Rejected. Resolution decides which runtime to acquire, so it runs where no runtime exists yet. A primitive would need a host-side fallback for exactly the first-run case, which is two implementations of one contract.
- **Predicting the archive's directory name from the ref.** Rejected in favour of deriving it from the extraction. The name follows GitHub's rule, which already differs between `main` and a `ductus-v*` tag. A prediction would restate that rule and break silently when it changed.
- **Recording the ref before validating it.** Rejected. A bad `--ref` would then persist, and every later plain run would halt on it until someone edited the config by hand.
- **Recording it at the end of the run.** Rejected. The self-update's stale path aborts in pre-flight, so the choice would be lost on exactly the run that needs it.
- **A removal action on `merge-managed-block` for `--ref=latest`.** Not taken. A bare `[source]` table reads as the default with no runtime change. The cost is an empty table left in the config of a project that once chose a ref.
- **The migration floor from the target tag's registry alone.** Rejected. It cannot tell a migration newer than the tag from a retired one, and those need opposite answers.
- **Verification before release.** Rejected as insufficient on its own.
  - What can be exercised before the release exists: every halt; the `main` path end to end in a scratch project, using the working-tree bootstrap; and the installer's parsing and resolution against a stubbed `curl`. Pre-release, `latest` resolves to `ductus-v0.54.2`, which exercises the redirect read and the floor halt for real.
  - What cannot: the latest-release and named-tag *success* paths (AC1; AC3's first half) and the installer download (AC12). No release carries this spec yet, and every existing tag is below the floor.
  - Those paths share their URL construction with the `main` path and with the installer test, and differ only in the ref substituted. AC12 is machine-checked by the release run's new installer job. The success paths are observed on the release run's first adopter-side `/ductus`, in the same sitting.
  - This is a known limitation, not a deferral. Its evidence is recorded in the review.
- **The `main` source moving within one run.** Accepted, as the spec's Edge Cases state. Resolving `main` to a commit would need a GitHub API call, whose unauthenticated limit the spec's resolution answer rejected.
- **The rollout window.** For roughly eleven minutes after the tag is pushed, adopters whose bootstrap self-updates from `main` halt on the floor with a message saying so. That is bounded, visible, and the same class of window `AGENTS.md` already documents for a version bump.
