# Fetch-archive-reads-its-proxy-once

## Context

`fetch-archive` builds a new `reqwest` client on every call and never turns off reqwest's system proxy. Each build therefore reads `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` (and their lowercase forms), plus `REQUEST_METHOD`, from the environment, through `hyper-util`'s proxy matcher. On Linux and other non-Apple Unix it also reads `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR`, through the certificate verifier each client builds. 062's review found two consequences on 2026-09-29:

- The long-lived MCP server re-reads those variables on every fetch, which `CFG-ENV-001` forbids (read once at startup and cache). 062 moved every variable the runtime itself reads to a one-time capture in `main`, including this primitive's `DUCTUS_FETCH_ALLOW_INSECURE_HOSTS`. The proxy and certificate variables are read by the dependency, so 062's review waived them there and routed them here.
- With a proxy set, the connection is tunnelled through the proxy, which resolves the target itself. The `resolve_to_addrs` pin that `validate_fetch_url` sets — the guard against DNS rebinding between screening an address and connecting to it — then no longer holds.

## Behavior

`fetch-archive` reads its proxy configuration once, at startup, like every other variable the runtime reads, and its certificate configuration once per process, at its first fetch. No fetch reads either from the environment again, and `docs/runtime.md`'s inventory lists both. Through a proxy, the operator's proxy is the documented trust boundary: the local screen still runs on every URL and redirect hop, and a direct connection stays pinned to the addresses it screened.

## Edge Cases

- An adopter behind a corporate proxy must still be able to fetch. Turning proxies off (`.no_proxy()`) would stop the per-fetch reads and restore the pin, but it would break acquisition for them.
- With `REQUEST_METHOD` set (a CGI environment), the matcher ignores every proxy variable. A captured configuration has to keep that guard.
- A proxy value that does not parse, or names a scheme the matcher does not support, is skipped as the matcher skips it today, so that scheme's fetches go direct.
- A process that never captured the proxy variables, such as an in-process test, fetches with proxies off and reads nothing from the environment.
- On Linux and other non-Apple Unix, a system store that yields no certificate fails the fetch with an error saying so, as the platform verifier does, rather than failing every handshake. A process that never fetches never loads the store.

## Open Questions

*None — all resolved.*

## Resolved Questions

- **Should fetch-archive honor proxies from a startup capture (an explicit reqwest proxy configuration built from the variables read once in main), or turn system proxies off?** → A startup capture. `main` reads `ALL_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` once — each uppercase first, then lowercase, a set but empty uppercase value winning — and whether `REQUEST_METHOD` is set, as it captures the insecure-host allowlist. Each fetch applies the captured values as explicit reqwest proxies with the captured `NO_PROXY`, or turns proxies off when none is set or `REQUEST_METHOD` is set. Grounded 2026-09-30 in the locked sources: without reqwest's `system-proxy` feature, which `runtime/Cargo.toml` leaves off, the client's system matcher reads exactly those variables on every build (hyper-util 0.1.20, `client/proxy/matcher.rs`, `Builder::from_env`), and an explicit proxy or `.no_proxy()` turns that read off (reqwest 0.13.4, `async_impl/client.rs`, `ClientBuilder::proxy` and `no_proxy`). Explicit `Proxy::http`, `Proxy::https` and `Proxy::all` compile to the same matcher builder (`proxy.rs`, `into_matcher`), so the capture keeps today's selection: an `https` URL takes `HTTPS_PROXY`, else `ALL_PROXY`; an `http` URL takes `HTTP_PROXY`, else `ALL_PROXY`; `NO_PROXY` exempts its hosts. Turning proxies off was rejected: it would end acquisition for every adopter behind a proxy, which the first edge case forbids.
- **When a fetch goes through a proxy that resolves the host itself, how does the SSRF screen hold — or is the operator's proxy the documented trust boundary?** → The operator's proxy is the documented trust boundary, and the local screen is unchanged. `validate_fetch_url` still resolves and screens the first URL and every redirect hop, so nothing refused today is fetched through a proxy. A direct connection, with no proxy set or to a `NO_PROXY` host, stays pinned to the screened addresses. Through a proxy, reqwest sends the hostname in its `CONNECT`, and the proxy resolves it: what it resolves and reaches is the policy of the operator who configured it, and `docs/runtime.md` and the primitive's doc comment say so. The gap cannot be closed from the runtime's side. A `CONNECT` to the screened address would fail TLS hostname verification. Screening the proxy's own address would refuse the common corporate proxy on a private address, and would not bind what the proxy resolves anyway. Two alternatives were rejected: skipping local resolution for a proxied hostname, which drops the screen for a case no adopter is known to have, and refusing proxied fetches unless an operator opts in, which breaks acquisition by default behind a proxy.
- **When are the certificate variables read?** → Once per process, at its first fetch. On Linux and other non-Apple Unix, reqwest builds `rustls-platform-verifier`'s verifier on every client build, which loads the system store through `rustls_native_certs::load_native_certs` and so reads `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` (rustls-platform-verifier 0.7.0, `verification/others.rs`, `new_inner`). There that verifier is WebPKI over the native roots, and reqwest's `tls_certs_only` builds the same WebPKI verifier over the roots it is given, with the same crypto provider (reqwest 0.13.4, `async_impl/client.rs`, the `with_root_certificates` branch). So the first fetch loads the roots once, the process keeps them, and every fetch passes them through `tls_certs_only`. Apple platforms and Windows verify through the operating system and read no certificate variable, so they keep the platform verifier. Loading at startup was rejected: it would parse the system store on every invocation, every pre-commit hook call among them, for processes that never fetch. Decided by the operator 2026-09-30.
