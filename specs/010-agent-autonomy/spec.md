# 010 — Agent Autonomy

Evaluate capabilities found in autonomous agent orchestration tools (e.g., GSD-2) and determine which can be adopted within `ductus`'s constraints: zero dependencies, markdown-only artifacts, platform-agnostic, and human-in-the-loop pipeline gates.

> **Note (post-completion, [043-workflows-sunset](../043-workflows-sunset/spec.md)):** the `skills/` → `workflows/` rename this spec delivered was itself sunset — the workflows feature no longer exists, and the `workflows-sunset` migration cleans up both directory generations in adopter projects. Body references to workflows below are historical.

Each capability is evaluated independently. The outcome for each is one of: **adopt** (add to `ductus`), **adapt** (modify the concept to fit `ductus`'s model), or **decline** (not a fit).

## Completion record (2026-08-17)

**Closed.** Task 17 — the next-step offer — shipped in `ductus-v0.29.2`, and the
scenario's open question was resolved by the operator: **name one task, and say
how many remain after it.** A menu re-renders a slice of `tasks.md` after every
completion; the count recovers most of its value, and looking further ahead is a
free-text redirect like any other. The reasoning is in the scenario's Resolved
Questions.

What actually held the spec open at the end was a stale review:
[`implement-offers-the-next-step`](scenarios/implement-offers-the-next-step.md)
was edited after the recorded `reviewed-against`, a real contract change rather
than a rename, so the mechanical-sweep exemption correctly did not apply. The
closing `/{project}:review` run reported one advisory `QUAL-CLAIM-001` against
`SweepIndex::build` — the staleness machinery itself — which was **fixed** rather
than carried, per this repo's rule that a SHOULD gates `done` exactly as a MUST
does. That fix shipped as `ductus-v0.29.3`.

Three acceptance criteria are annotated **superseded** in place: AC7 and AC8
(the `[simple]` marker and its `/{project}:plan` proposal step, dropped by
`017-derive-dont-ask`) and half of AC14 (`framework/workflows/`, sunset by
`043-workflows-sunset`). They stay checked because 010 delivered them; the
removals belong to the later specs. The annotations exist because nothing
detects a later spec invalidating an earlier one's criterion — an inbox item
records that gap.

## Capabilities Under Evaluation

### Skills system

Composable, context-specific instruction sets loaded based on task type. Currently `ductus` uses a single monolithic `AGENTS.md` per project. A skills system would split this into reusable skill files that commands selectively reference.

- Current state: `AGENTS.md` covers all conventions in one file
- GSD-2 approach: 16 bundled skill profiles loaded by task context
- `ductus` opportunity: skill files in a `skills/` directory, selectively `@import`-ed by commands or CLAUDE.md based on task type

**Verdict: adapt.** Adopt Anthropic/Claude Code's "skills" terminology for context-loaded instruction packs (the only mainstream vendor using the term — they use it for agent-loaded specialized capabilities, matching this concept). Layering, not replacement: `AGENTS.md` stays as the always-loaded baseline; the `AGENTS.md` template gains an optional "Skills" index section listing available skill files and the task types/topics that activate them. `ductus` documents the pattern and the per-platform mapping (Claude Code skills, Cursor rules, etc.) but does not prescribe a fixed directory or ship platform-specific files. Adopters who don't decompose leave the index empty.

Cross-spec impact on 005: 005's "skills" are functionally tech-stack-conditional development **workflows** (lint, test, format, migrate — scaffolded as slash commands into `.claude/commands/{slug}/`), not skills in the Anthropic sense. To free the term for 010's use, 005's concept is renamed to "workflows" — see Acceptance Criteria.

### Complexity routing

Classify tasks by complexity to inform model selection and batching. Currently `ductus` treats all tasks uniformly regardless of scope.

- Current state: lightweight-vs-standard track decision at spec level only
- GSD-2 approach: simple/standard/complex classification with automatic model routing
- `ductus` opportunity: complexity field in `tasks.md` entries; `implement` command uses this to suggest model or batch simple tasks

> **Note (post-completion, `017-derive-dont-ask`):** the `[simple]` marker this section adopts was delivered and then dropped — it exists nowhere under `framework/` today, and neither does the `/ductus:plan` proposal step. AC7 and AC8 below carry the same record. The verdict as written is historical.

**Verdict: adapt.** Cost matters and is rising; platform-level autorouting is opaque and unpredictable. Add an optional inline `[simple]` marker on tasks (no marker = default tier — whatever the adopter's platform config maps to "standard"). `/ductus:plan` proposes the marker on tasks it judges trivial; the user may add or remove markers during review (mirrors how the lightweight-track decision works). `/ductus:implement` reads the marker and surfaces a suggested model — does not auto-switch, since platforms differ in how model selection is exposed and the user remains in the loop.

Durable signal vs. volatile mapping: the marker (`[simple]`) lives in `tasks.md` and never changes with model releases; the per-platform mapping (which model "simple" routes to today) lives in adopter config (`AGENTS.md` or `system.md`), which adopters update as models evolve. `ductus` defines only the marker.

A `[complex]` tier was considered and declined — the default is already "use the strongest model," so a `complex` marker would not change behavior. May be added later if a concrete need arises.

### Stuck detection

Detect when an agent is cycling on the same task without progress. Currently `ductus` has no mechanism to identify repeated failed attempts.

- Current state: no detection — user must notice manually
- GSD-2 approach: sliding-window analysis of dispatch history catches cycles
- `ductus` opportunity: append-only execution log per spec; `implement` command checks for repeated attempts and suggests decomposition

**Verdict: decline the artifact, adopt the behavior.** No execution log file. An append-only markdown log duplicates information already encoded in `git log`, creates per-invocation git churn that fights the text-first-artifacts principle (artifacts should change with intent), introduces merge-conflict surface on parallel work, and gets out of sync the moment commits are squashed or rebased. Platform transcripts (Claude Code session history, Cursor chat) already capture richer signal than a markdown log can carry.

The stuck-detection *behavior* is worth adopting using existing signals: `/ductus:implement` instructions gain a step that reads `git log` for `tasks.md` and the current `tasks.md` checkbox state to detect when a task has been touched across N invocations without flipping to `[x]`. When detected, surface to the user and suggest decomposition. No new file, no schema, no git noise. (This sentence read *"for the affected paths"* until 2026-09-13; the plan narrowed the signal to `tasks.md` at plan time and said why — see its §Trade-offs — and that is what shipped.)

### Autonomous execution

Chain task execution without pausing for user approval between individual tasks within a phase. Currently every status change requires explicit approval.

- Current state: user approves every transition
- GSD-2 approach: full auto mode — agent loops until milestone is complete
- `ductus` opportunity: auto-advance between tasks within a phase while preserving approval gates at phase transitions (planned→done)

**Verdict: adapt.** Opt-in via `/ductus:implement --auto`, default off. Per-invocation flag (not session state, not spec frontmatter) — decision happens in execution context, not selection context, and matches CLI convention (flags modify the verb). The session file does not gain an `autoAdvance` field.

Constraints that still gate even with `--auto` on:

- Phase completion transition (`in-progress`→`done`) — per §pipeline-boundaries, unchanged. (The `planned`→`in-progress` transition is no longer gated: invoking `/ductus:implement` is itself the approval to start work, so it never prompts, with or without `--auto`. Superseded by [000-slash-commands](../000-slash-commands/spec.md)'s `implement-skips-planned-prompt` scenario per §cross-spec-impact.)
- Stuck-detection events (from the Stuck detection adoption above) — auto mode does not power through cycles.
- Spec edits, plan edits, or new tasks discovered mid-implement.
- Risky actions per the agent's safety rules (destructive ops, secrets, force pushes, etc.).

Without the flag, behavior is unchanged: user confirms each task. With the flag, `/ductus:implement` runs tasks in order, marks them complete, and advances within the current phase until one of the gates above fires.

### Parallel milestones

Work on multiple features concurrently with isolated git state. Currently `ductus` targets one feature at a time via a single session target.

- Current state: single-feature session (`session.json` holds one target)
- GSD-2 approach: multiple worktrees running concurrently with file-based coordination
- `ductus` opportunity: multi-target session, `--feature` flag on commands, guidance for worktree-based isolation

**Verdict: decline.** Single-target sessions stay. The pipeline is serial within a feature by design, and the rare case of working on two truly independent features at once is best served by two independent sessions in two terminals — git and the agent platform already provide isolation (`git worktree`, Claude Code's `isolation: "worktree"` agent parameter, Cursor's worktree integration). Multi-target session state would invite ambiguity (which target does the next command operate on? what if two targets have conflicting cross-spec impact?) without solving a real problem `ductus` has. Worktree workflow itself is git's job, not `ductus`'s.

The session file keeps holding one target. Documentation gains a one-paragraph note (in the constitution or `AGENTS.md` template) directing users to `git worktree` and platform isolation for concurrent feature work.

### Cost controls

Track token usage and enforce budget limits. Currently `ductus` has no cost awareness.

- Current state: no cost tracking — delegated entirely to the AI platform
- GSD-2 approach: per-task token/cost metrics, budget ceilings with warnings/pauses/halts
- `ductus` opportunity: unclear — `ductus` has nothing that observes a model call; this may remain the platform's responsibility

**Verdict: decline budget tooling, adopt a documentation cross-reference.** Per-task token tracking and budget ceilings require instrumenting the model call itself — that part is platform-level by definition. But several decisions in this spec are themselves cost-aware patterns; the remaining work is to name them and point at platform tooling for the runtime piece.

> **Note (post-completion, premise corrected 2026-09-13):** this verdict was argued in 2026 as *"require a runtime `ductus` does not have"*, which was true before spec 022. `ductus` now ships a required runtime ([§runtime-boundary](../../framework/constitution.md#runtime-boundary)), so the premise moved — but **the decision stands and is now better founded**: principle 2 forbids that runtime from calling an LLM, so it can never observe token usage. The wording was corrected here and in the constitution's `### Cost levers` paragraph in the same change.

The "Cost-conscious" principle already exists in the constitution (§principles → Business). It currently has no operational guidance. Add a short cross-reference paragraph (location TBD during planning — likely in the constitution near the principle, or in the `AGENTS.md` template) that names `ductus`'s existing cost levers:

- Lightweight track — skip the plan phase for small features — **removed by `023-govern-refinement`**
- `[simple]` tier marker on tasks (Q2 above) — route trivial work to cheaper models — **removed by `017-derive-dont-ask`**
- Stuck detection (Q3 above) — catch runaway loops before they compound spend
- Default-off autonomy (Q4 above) — human-in-the-loop gating contains blast radius

…and points at the adopter's platform (Claude Code's `/cost`, Anthropic usage dashboard, Cursor's request limits, etc.) for runtime cost controls.

No new artifact, no per-task estimates, no budget files. The cross-reference paragraph is the entire deliverable.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Evaluation completeness

- [x] AC1: Each capability has a recommendation: adopt, adapt, or decline
- [x] AC2: Adopted/adapted capabilities have a clear description of what changes to `ductus` artifacts
- [x] AC3: Declined capabilities have a rationale explaining why they don't fit
- [x] AC4: No capability introduces a runtime dependency or requires a specific AI platform
- [x] AC5: Changes respect command file parity (`framework/commands/` and `.claude/commands/ductus/`)
- [x] AC6: Changes respect bootstrap installer parity (`framework/bootstrap/` variants stay in sync)

### Concrete deliverables (from adapted capabilities)

- [x] AC7: `tasks.md` template documents the optional `[simple]` inline marker convention (one tier; no marker = default) — **superseded, delivered then removed**: the `[simple]` marker no longer exists anywhere under `framework/`, dropped by `017-derive-dont-ask`. Checked because 010 did deliver it; the removal is 017's, and 017 declares no dependency on 010, so this line is the only thing tying the two together.
- [x] AC8: `/ductus:plan` command instructions include a step to propose `[simple]` markers on tasks the agent judges trivial — **superseded, delivered then removed**: the proposal step no longer exists, dropped by `017-derive-dont-ask` alongside the marker in AC7.
- [x] AC9: `/ductus:implement` command instructions include a stuck-detection step that reads `git log` for `tasks.md` and its checkbox state, surfaces cycles, and suggests decomposition — this line read *"`git log` for affected paths"* until 2026-09-13; the plan declined affected-files history at plan time (§Trade-offs, *Stuck detection reads `tasks.md` commits, not affected-files commits*) because that history is noisy and would force the implementation to parse the plan's affected-files table, and neither the shipped step nor `check-stuck` ever read it. The criterion is corrected to the mechanism that was built, not annotated: nothing superseded it, the anticipated one was never delivered.
- [x] AC10: `/ductus:implement` command accepts an `--auto` flag that skips per-task confirmations within a phase, with the documented gates (phase transitions, stuck detection, spec/plan edits, mid-implement discovery, risky actions) still firing
- [x] AC11: Constitution `## Guiding Principles` → `Cost-conscious` (or a new dedicated subsection) gains a cross-reference paragraph naming `ductus`'s cost levers (lightweight track, `[simple]` marker, stuck detection, default-off autonomy) and pointing at platform tooling for runtime controls — **partially superseded, delivered then reduced**: `### Cost levers` exists and names **two** of the four. 010 delivered all four in `fc68cf1c`; `017-derive-dont-ask` removed the `[simple]` lever (`fc737946`, the same removal AC7 and AC8 record) and `023-govern-refinement` removed the lightweight track along with the section it linked (`dd8f7b41`). Checked because 010 delivered the enumeration as specified; the reductions belong to 017 and 023, neither of which declares 010.
- [x] AC12: `AGENTS.md` project template gains an optional "Skills" index section listing available skill files and their activation conditions (empty by default)
- [x] AC13: Documentation note added (constitution or `AGENTS.md` template) directing users to `git worktree` and platform isolation for concurrent feature work

### Cross-spec deliverable

- [x] AC14: If the skills capability is delivered, 005's concept is renamed from "skills" to "workflows" (cross-spec impact: reopens 005 to `in-progress` per §cross-spec-impact). Affected paths in `ductus`: `framework/skills/` → `framework/workflows/` (flattened — registry and workflow files sit at the same level, no inner `templates/` directory), `skills/registry.json` → `workflows/registry.json`, `specs/005-skills-and-plugins/` → `specs/005-workflows/` (spec directory rename), and prose updates in 005's spec, plan, tasks, and any project templates that reference the term. — **partially superseded**: the `specs/005-workflows/` rename stands, but `framework/workflows/` no longer exists, sunset by `043-workflows-sunset` (which does declare 010, so that half is traceable from its frontmatter). Checked because 010 delivered the rename as specified; the later sunset is 043's.

## Open Questions

(none — all resolved; see Resolved Questions below)

## Resolved Questions

1. **Skills system: replace `AGENTS.md` or layer on top?** — Layer on top. `AGENTS.md` remains the always-loaded baseline; the template gains an optional "Skills" index section listing available skill files and the task types/topics that activate them (empty by default). Verdict for the capability is **adapt**: `ductus` documents the pattern and per-platform mapping (Claude Code skills, Cursor rules, etc.) without prescribing a fixed directory or shipping platform-specific files. Terminology aligns with Anthropic/Claude Code's "skills" — the only mainstream vendor using the term, and they use it for context-loaded instruction packs (matching this concept). 005's "skills" are functionally tech-stack-conditional development workflows (lint, test, format, migrate); per §cross-spec-impact, 005 is renamed to "workflows" so 010 can use the standard term — see Acceptance Criteria.
2. **Complexity routing: who assigns?** — Hybrid: `/ductus:plan` proposes, user may override. Granularity: single optional `[simple]` inline marker on tasks (no marker = default tier). Verdict for the capability is **adapt**. Rationale: agentic-coding cost is rising and platform autorouting is opaque, so an explicit signal in `tasks.md` gives the user visibility and control. The marker is the durable signal; the per-platform model mapping ("simple" → which model today) lives in adopter config so model churn doesn't rot specs. `[complex]` tier declined as redundant against the default.
3. **Execution log: worth maintaining?** — No. Verdict for the capability is **decline the artifact, adopt the behavior**. No persisted execution log: an append-only markdown file duplicates `git log`, creates per-invocation git churn that fights text-first-artifacts (artifacts should change with intent), and goes out of sync on squash/rebase. The stuck-detection *behavior* is adopted using existing signals — `/ductus:implement` reads `git log` for `tasks.md` and its checkbox state to detect tasks touched across N invocations without completing, then surfaces the cycle and suggests decomposition. (Read *"for affected paths"* until 2026-09-13; the plan declined affected-files history at plan time, and `tasks.md` is what shipped — see AC9.)
4. **Autonomous execution: opt-in or default?** — Opt-in via `/ductus:implement --auto`, default off. Verdict for the capability is **adapt**. Per-invocation flag rather than session state or spec frontmatter — autonomy is an execution-time decision, not a selection-time or spec-level property, and putting it on the verb that does work matches CLI convention. The session file does not gain an `autoAdvance` field. Phase boundaries, stuck-detection events, spec/plan edits, mid-implement task discovery, and risky actions all continue to gate even with the flag on; the flag only skips per-task confirmations within a phase. Default-off matches the constitutional spirit (§pipeline-boundaries) of keeping the human in the loop unless explicitly opted out.
5. **Parallel milestones: prescribe worktree management?** — No. Verdict for the capability is **decline**. Single-target sessions stay. The pipeline is serial within a feature by design; concurrent work on independent features uses independent sessions in independent terminals, with isolation provided by `git worktree` and platform features (Claude Code's `isolation: "worktree"`, Cursor's worktree integration). Multi-target session state would introduce ambiguity (which target does the next command operate on?) without solving a real `ductus` problem. Documentation gains a one-paragraph note pointing users at the platform/git mechanisms — staying focused on one spec at a time supports parallel work via separate sessions, not via in-session multi-targeting.
6. **Cost guidance beyond platform controls?** — Yes, but only as documentation. Verdict for the capability is **decline budget tooling, adopt a documentation cross-reference**. Per-task token tracking and budget ceilings require instrumenting the model call itself, which `ductus`'s runtime is forbidden to do. The "Cost-conscious" constitutional principle (§principles → Business) gains a short paragraph naming `ductus`'s existing cost levers (lightweight track, `[simple]` tier marker, stuck detection, default-off autonomy) and pointing at the adopter's platform tooling for runtime controls. No new artifact, no per-task estimates, no budget files. **The decision stands; two of the four levers do not** — see AC11 and the §Cost controls note above.
